      <h1 style=color:blue>Happy Birthday Paj!!!</h1>
      <h2 style=color:blue>Dear Paj,</h2>
    <p style=color:blue>Its the most wonderful day of the year. I am so excited for your birthday! I love you more than words can say. You are truly one of the most special and influential people in my life. I can't believe that I got so lucky, getting the gift of you as my dad. You are able to bring so much love, joy, and light with you wherever you go. Every person who has encountered you sees it--you are someone who is truly special and makes the world a better place. </p>

    <p style=color:blue>It's impossible to put into words how special you are to me, and how valued you are by all who know you. But I wanted to start by metaphorically shouting it from the rooftops by putting it on your very own website! I don't know what I would do without you, and I hope you know how loved and appreciated you are today and every day.</p>
